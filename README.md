# ElizaPad — TEK Signal Engine

**ElizaPad** is a Solana-focused launchpad built around **AI-assisted curation** and **technical signal surfacing**.  
At its core is **TEK** — a signal engine designed to analyze **token structure and risk indicators**, not price action or market hype.

The objective is to improve launch quality and discovery by prioritizing **signal over noise**.

## What is TEK?

**TEK** is a technical signal system for Solana tokens.

It evaluates indicators such as:
- Token structure and configuration
- Authority and permission states
- Supply and control indicators
- Metadata completeness and consistency
- Common on-chain risk signals

TEK is designed to **surface information**, not to make decisions.

TEK is **not**:
- A price prediction tool
- A profit indicator
- A ranking or leaderboard
- Financial advice

Users remain fully responsible for their own decisions.

## What is ElizaPad?

**ElizaPad** is the interface and workflow layer that presents TEK signals in a clear, accessible format.

The broader vision includes:
- AI-assisted launch flows
- Automated metadata validation
- Signal-based discovery instead of hype-driven ranking
- Reduced exposure to low-effort or poorly structured launches

The system architecture is designed around **agent-based AI workflows inspired by ElizaOS**, enabling modular analysis, validation, and curation logic.

## Design Principles

- **Structure first** — technical clarity over marketing
- **Transparency** — surface signals without manipulation
- **Neutrality** — no paid placement or bias
- **User agency** — tools inform, users decide

---

## Capabilities

- Technical signal generation (TEK)
- Structured signal visualization
- Wallet-based identity for launch attribution
- Metadata and configuration analysis

---

## Future Direction

Planned areas of expansion include:
- Signal refinement and weighting
- Agent-driven curation logic
- Public signal exploration tools
- Deeper on-chain analysis
- Optional integrations with Solana programs

Development follows an iterative, signal-driven approach rather than fixed timelines.
